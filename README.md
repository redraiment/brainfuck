# brainfuck

Here are toy interpreters (and maybe compilers) of [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) language.

## Projects

* **DONE** [brainfuck-translator-in-clojure-macro](https://github.com/redraiment/brainfuck/tree/main/brainfuck-translator-in-clojure-macro): a clojure translator macro, which translates brainfuck source code to clojure source code in compile time. Use brainfuck as embedded DSL in clojure.
* **DOING** [brainfuck-interpreter-in-ansi-c](https://github.com/redraiment/brainfuck/tree/main/brainfuck-interpreter-in-ansi-c): an interpreter without third party dependency in pure ANSI C.
* **TODO** brainfuck-interpreter-in-llvm-jit: an interpreter with flex, bison and LLVM JIT in C.
* **TODO** brainfuck-compiler-in-llvm: a compiler to output LLVM bitcode in C.
* samples: some brainfuck samples.
